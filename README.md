# route-optimization
TODO:
- Check authorization for all endpoints (Mostly done)
- Passenger count > 1
- Handle trips ar 12am
- Put the Tokens in a config file (backend)
- Enforce Strong Passwords
- Implement other pages (About, Contact, User Settings, etc.)


FIXME: 
- The current location is not being updated in the rider's app
- Check the map reload as it draws the new route on the old route then removes the old route on the next update (BusPath)
